# Sound theme maker
A graphical editor for sound themes in Linux. I created this tool to simplify the creation of custom sound themes.

## How to run
Install `kdialog`, `ffmpeg`, and `qt6-tools` (or maybe `qt5-tools`) to your system if you haven't already.  
Debian users: install `qtchooser` instead of `qt6-tools` or `qt5-tools`.

Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
Then you can launch the tool:
```
python3 soundthememaker.py
```
